/**
 * SYNTHETIC PLACEHOLDER DATA -- NOT A REAL BIBLE TRANSLATION.
 *
 * These are NOT verbatim scripture quotations from any copyrighted or
 * licensed translation, and are not written to resemble scripture --
 * wording is a plain, obviously-synthetic "development content" template
 * so this file cannot be mistaken for, or accidentally shipped as,
 * licensed Bible text.
 *
 * Current status (see /BIBLE_LICENSING.md for full detail):
 *   - English (WEB): RESOLVED -- real World English Bible (public
 *     domain) verse text is now sourced and used instead (see
 *     webBible.ts). The `en` pool below is still generated (this
 *     function stays generic over BibleLanguage) but dataSource.ts no
 *     longer reads it in the normal path -- only as an unreachable
 *     defensive fallback if a future data revision ever omits a
 *     book/chapter the WEB dataset should cover.
 *   - Telugu (IRV 2019): RESOLVED -- real, CC BY-SA 4.0-licensed verse
 *     text is now sourced and used instead (see teluguBible.ts). The
 *     `te` pool below is still generated, and dataSource.ts still reads
 *     it for exactly two chapters (Joel 3, Malachi 4) that have no real
 *     verse text in the imported source -- see teluguBible.ts's doc
 *     comment for why -- so it is not purely a defensive fallback the
 *     way the `en` pool is.
 *
 * PLACEHOLDER DATASET SIZE -- per FINAL_ARCHITECTURE_SPECIFICATION.md's
 * Day 8 section verbatim: "IF Bible source NOT verified: Use 100-200
 * placeholder verses + clear labeling" (also stated generally at line
 * 321). PLACEHOLDER_POOL_SIZE below is 150 distinct entries per
 * language, within that range. This is a bounded, reusable POOL of
 * distinct placeholder text, not a per-chapter count: the Day 8 approval
 * separately requires full, accurate 66-book/real-chapter-count
 * navigation (requirements C/D), so every real chapter of every real
 * book is still reachable -- what's bounded to 100-200 is the amount of
 * distinct placeholder TEXT that exists, which buildPlaceholderVerses()
 * below deterministically distributes across those chapters (different
 * chapters draw different pool entries), so navigation demonstrably
 * shows different content per chapter without pretending to have a full,
 * separate placeholder verse for all ~31,000 real Bible verses.
 *
 * Per FINAL_ARCHITECTURE_SPECIFICATION.md Section C, Option 3: placeholder
 * content is an explicitly sanctioned way to build and test the Bible
 * screens' UI/navigation/caching now, without blocking on Bible licensing
 * or sourcing.
 *
 * Only dataSource.ts reads this file -- screens never import it directly
 * (see dataSource.ts's getChapter()).
